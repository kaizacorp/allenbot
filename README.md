React app for displaying all the wonderful [Library of Allenxandria](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLibraryofAllenxandria) gifs!

Currently hosted using GitHub Pages at https://kaizacorp.github.io/allenbot/

## TODO:

- gifs as links to gif specific pages/modal?:
    + to show tags
    + 'copy link' button

- page listing all gifs by their tags?
- refresh page when scrolling-up at top of page on mobile?
- link to top of page in footer?
- infinite scroll [requires changes in backend to implement the standard way]


- implemented in some form in backend, but dependant on [allenxandria-gif-api](https://github.com/kaizacorp/allenxandria-gif-api/) updates/deployment:

    + request all gifs via allenxandria-gif-api 
    + random gifs for initial page 
    + option to sort by most recent 
    + option to sort by most popular
